### Service Providers

- **Supabase** (database and authentication) — Stores your account data, picks, and pool information. Supabase's privacy policy applies to data processed by their infrastructure. Learn more at https://supabase.com/privacy.

- **ESPN** (game data) — We fetch publicly available game schedules and scores. We do not send any user data to ESPN.

We do not share your personal information with any other third parties.

### Legal Requirements

We may disclose your information if required by law, legal process, or government request, or if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Farrar Analytics LLC, our users, or the public.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

Your data is stored on Supabase's cloud infrastructure, which uses encryption at rest and in transit. We implement row-level security policies to ensure users can only access data they are authorized to view.

While we take reasonable measures to protect your information, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 5. Data Retention

We retain your account data and pool activity for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we will remove your personal information within 30 days, except where we are required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes (such as maintaining pool integrity for active tournaments).

Aggregated, anonymized data that cannot be used to identify you may be retained indefinitely for analytical purposes.

## 6. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:

- **Access** the personal information we hold about you
- **Correct** inaccurate or incomplete information
- **Delete** your account and associated personal information
- **Export** your data in a portable format
- **Object** to certain processing of your information

To exercise any of these rights, contact us at info@survivethedance.com. We will respond within 30 days.

## 7. Children's Privacy

The Platform is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will promptly delete it.

## 8. Cookies and Local Storage

The Platform uses browser local storage to maintain your login session and remember your active pool selection. We do not use tracking cookies, third-party analytics cookies, or advertising cookies.

Session data stored in your browser is used solely to keep you logged in and provide a functional user experience. You can clear this data at any time through your browser settings, though this will require you to log in again.

## 9. Do Not Track

We do not track users across third-party websites. The Platform does not respond to "Do Not Track" browser signals because we do not engage in cross-site tracking.

- The right to request deletion of your personal information
