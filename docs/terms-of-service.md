**Effective Date:** February 9, 2026  
**Last Updated:** February 9, 2026

Welcome to Survive the Dance ("the Platform," "the Service"), a free-to-play survivor pool game for NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament fans. The Platform is owned and operated by **Farrar Analytics LLC** ("we," "us," "our").

By creating an account or using the Platform, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.

## 1. About the Service

Survive the Dance is a free, entertainment-only survivor pool platform. Users pick one team per tournament round to win their game. If the team wins, the user survives. If the team loses, the user is eliminated. Each team can only be picked once throughout the tournament.

The Platform does not involve real money wagering, gambling, or betting of any kind. We do not accept, hold, process, or facilitate any financial transactions, entry fees, prize pools, or monetary exchanges between users. Any off-platform financial arrangements between users (e.g., informal bets among friends) are entirely outside the scope of this Platform and are the sole responsibility of the parties involved.

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old to create an account. By using the Platform, you represent that you meet this age requirement. If you are under 18, you represent that a parent or legal guardian has reviewed and consented to these Terms on your behalf.

## 3. User Accounts

When you create an account, you agree to provide accurate information including a valid email address. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account.

You may create one account per person. Creating multiple accounts to gain an unfair advantage in pools is prohibited and may result in account suspension.

## 4. Pool Participation

Users may create pools and invite others to join via a unique join code. Pool creators set pool parameters such as name and maximum entries per user.

By joining a pool, you agree to abide by the rules of the survivor format. Failure to submit a pick before the round deadline results in automatic elimination.

Pool creators have administrative control over their pools, including the ability to manage settings. Pool creators do not represent Farrar Analytics LLC and are not authorized to make commitments on our behalf.

## 5. Prohibited Conduct

You agree not to:

- Use the Platform for any illegal purpose or in violation of any applicable law
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to other users' accounts or the Platform's systems
- Use bots, scripts, or automated tools to interact with the Platform
- Harass, threaten, or abuse other users
- Impersonate another person or entity
- Interfere with or disrupt the Platform's infrastructure
- Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or extract source code from the Platform
- Use the Platform to facilitate real money gambling in jurisdictions where such activity is prohibited

## 6. Third-Party Data

The Platform relies on data from third-party sources, including ESPN, for game schedules, scores, and results. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of this data.
