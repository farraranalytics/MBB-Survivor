# About — Survive the Dance

## What is Survive the Dance?

Survive the Dance is a free survivor pool game for the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. Each round, you pick one team to win their game. Get it right, you survive. Get it wrong, you're out. The catch: you can only use each team once the entire tournament. As the rounds go on, your options shrink and the stakes get higher.

Create a pool, invite your friends, and see who can survive the longest.

## How It Works

1. **Create or join a pool** using a unique join code
2. **Pick one team per round** to win their game before the deadline
3. **If your team wins**, you survive to the next round
4. **If your team loses** (or you forget to pick), you're eliminated
5. **Each team can only be used once** — choose wisely
6. **Last one standing wins**

## Who Built This?

Survive the Dance was designed and built by **Farrar Analytics LLC**, a data analytics and software consulting firm based in Boise, Idaho.

We're a small team that loves basketball, data, and building things people enjoy using. Survive the Dance started as a side project to make March Madness more fun with friends, and we're excited to share it with you.

## Important Notes
